# System Design Document: TODO App

## 1. Introduction

The System Design Document outlines the architecture and technical aspects of the TODO app. This application allows users to manage their tasks by creating, reading, updating, and deleting them. The app is developed using React Native (Expo for multi-platform), Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## 2. Architecture Goals and Concerns

- **Scalability**: The architecture should allow for easy scaling of both frontend and backend components to accommodate future growth.
- **Security**: Implement strong security measures to protect user data and ensure safe access to the application.
- **Usability**: Create a user-friendly interface accessible from multiple platforms (iOS, Android, and web).
- **Performance**: Optimize the application for efficient data retrieval and rendering.
- **Reliability**: Ensure the app remains available and responsive, even under heavy usage.

## 3. Frontend Architecture (React Native Expo)

### Overview

The frontend of the TODO app is built using React Native with Expo, allowing for cross-platform compatibility.

#### Components

- **UI Components**: React Native components for creating the user interface, including screens, navigation elements, buttons, and forms.
- **State Management**: Redux manages the application state, including user data, tasks, and UI states.
- **Navigation**: React Navigation provides seamless navigation between screens and tabs.
- **API Integration**: Axios or Fetch is used to communicate with the backend API.

### Supported Platforms

- **iOS**: The app is compatible with iOS devices.
- **Android**: The app is compatible with Android devices.
- **Web**: The app can also be accessed via web browsers, thanks to Expo for web support.

## 4. Backend Architecture (Express.js)

### Overview

The backend of the TODO app is implemented using Express.js, a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework.

#### Components

- **Routes**: Define API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks and user authentication.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware for authentication, request validation, and error handling.
- **Controllers**: Handle the core business logic, interact with the database, and respond to API requests.

## 5. Data Models and Database (PostgreSQL)

### Data Models

The app has two main data models:

- **User Model**: Stores user information, including username and hashed password.
- **Task Model**: Stores task data, including task title, description, status, and user ID for ownership.

### Database

- **Database Engine**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage.
- **Schema**: The database schema defines tables for users and tasks.
- **Queries**: SQL queries and statements are used to interact with the database.

## 6. Security 

- **User Authentication**: Users are required to authenticate using a username and password.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.
- **API Security**: API endpoints are secured using tokens or session-based authentication.
- **Data Validation**: Input validation is enforced on both frontend and backend to prevent malicious or erroneous data.

## 7. Deployment

- **Frontend**: The React Native Expo-based frontend is deployed using Expo's hosting service, Vercel, or Netlify for web deployment.
- **Backend**: The Express.js backend is deployed to a cloud server using services like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. Environment variables secure sensitive information.
- **Database**: The PostgreSQL database is hosted and configured for backend access.

## 8. User Experience (UX) Design

- **UI/UX Guidelines**: Describe the user interface and user experience design principles, including the use of color schemes, typography, icons, and layout.
- **Wireframes and Prototypes**: Include wireframes or prototype designs to visually represent the app's screens and user interactions.

## 9. Error Handling (TBD)

- **Error Messages**: Document how error messages and notifications are presented to users in case of validation errors, network issues, or other problems.
- **Logging**: Explain how errors are logged on the server for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## 10. Testing and Quality Assurance (TBD)

- **Testing Strategy**: Outline the testing approach, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- **Tools**: Mention the testing tools and frameworks used for automated testing.
- **Quality Assurance**: Describe the quality assurance process, including code reviews and bug tracking.

## 11. Performance Optimization (TBD)

- **Optimization Techniques**: Explain how the app's performance is optimized, including techniques for minimizing load times, reducing bandwidth usage, and handling large datasets efficiently.

## 12. Third-Party Services

- **API Integrations**: If the app integrates with external services or APIs (e.g., weather data, social media sharing), document the integration points and how data is exchanged.

## 13. Accessibility (TBD)

- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure that the app follows accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to make it accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Accessibility Features**: Detail accessibility features implemented, such as screen reader support and keyboard navigation.

## 14. Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

- **Internationalization**: Describe how the app is prepared for internationalization, including support for multiple languages and cultures.
- **Localization**: Explain the localization process for translating the app's content and UI elements.

## 15. Backup and Recovery (TBD)

- **Data Backup**: Document how data is regularly backed up to prevent data loss in case of server failures.
- **Disaster

 Recovery**: Outline the disaster recovery plan, including steps to restore the app in case of catastrophic events.

## 16. Version Control and Collaboration

- **Version Control**: Github with semver is the version control system (e.g., Git) used for code management.
- **Collaboration Tools (TBD)**:  Mention collaboration and communication tools used by the development team (e.g., Slack, Trello).

## 17. Documentation (TBD)

- **Code Documentation**: Describe the code documentation standards used (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript).
- **User Documentation**: Mention the availability of user guides or documentation for app users.

## 18. Maintenance and Support (TBD)

- **Maintenance Plan**: Explain the plan for ongoing maintenance and updates of the app, including bug fixes and feature enhancements.
- **Support Channels**: Provide contact information or support channels for users to report issues or seek assistance.

## 19. Legal and Compliance

- **Privacy Policy**: If the app collects user data, specify the privacy policy in compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Terms of Service**: If applicable, outline the terms of service and legal considerations for app usage.

## 20. Future Roadmap

- **Feature Roadmap**: Discuss potential future features or enhancements planned for the app beyond the initial release.
